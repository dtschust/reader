It\u0026#8217;s never ending. The amount of clothes that two kids (and two adults) can go through in a week is mind blowing. At my house, I\u0026#8217;m pretty certain we could run an entire load of laundry every day. One of the things I have been noticing is that our towels and sheets always seem to take two runs through the dryer in order to get fully dry. A friend of mine mentioned he was having the same issue until he purchased the \u003Ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GA9P5P0?tag=toolsandtoys-20\"\u003ESmart Sheep 6-Pack Premium Wool Dryer Balls\u003C/a\u003E.

I learned that rational investors always make the right decisions based on facts and statistics, not on emotions or gut reactions, and that\u2019s why markets are so efficient over the long term.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the sterile world of academia, it\u2019s easy to know the right thing to do: Buy when prices are low, sell when prices are high, and stay invested for the long run.\u00a0\u003Ca href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/finance/financial-advisors/questions/asset-allocation\"\u003ESecurities\u003C/a\u003E should be bought or sold based on their fundamentals, not a neighbor\u2019s advice or an impulse driven by fear or excitement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EArmed with these theories, reinforced over many years of study, I set off to become a financial advisor \u2014 to help people reach their financial goals through rational and unemotional planning and investing.\u00a0I truly believed it was basically just a numbers game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, once I started working with real flesh-and-blood people (not hypothetical \u201crational people\u201d), it quickly became apparent that there are very few, if any, purely rational investors (or financial advisors, for that matter).\u00a0If you stop and think about the people in your life, I\u2019m quite sure you\u2019ll agree that humans tend to lead with their hearts and guts, not their rational minds. It\u2019s one of the most endearing qualities of being human. We all thought the cold, calculating, \u2018logical\u2019 side of the half-human, half-Vulcan Mr. Spock was cool \u2014 but we loved him because of the irrational, emotional, human side.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA full-blooded Vulcan would make an excellent investor and would surely adhere to rational choice theory. For us humans, our impetuous, impulsive nature, which tends to make us so interesting, also results in our having inherently bad investing instincts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI was out walking recently, when a thought occurred to me that I think outlines the idea.\u00a0Say you\u2019re on a hike, and you come across a large bear.\u00a0The rational thing to do, according to most experts, is to either lie down and play dead or stand as tall as you can and try to impress the bear with your size and ferocity.\u00a0Having read your trusty wilderness guide, if you were to adhere to the laws of rational choice theory, you would choose one of these tactics, perhaps depending on the type of bear you\u2019re facing and how the bear seems to be acting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds good on paper, but in real life, it would be very hard (if not impossible) for most people to do. In reality, if confronted with this situation, most of us would do exactly the \u201cwrong\u201d (or irrational) thing, which is to run for our lives. The fight-or-flight mechanism in our brains that makes us feel the need to \u2018do something\u2019 in the face of a threat can have highly detrimental effects in certain situations. When it comes to \u003Ca href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/finance/financial-advisors/questions?search=compounded+returns\"\u003Elong-term success\u003C/a\u003E as an investor, it can be calamitous.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have learned in the years since leaving school is that to be a great advisor, and to truly help your clients stay on track toward their goals, you need to be good with numbers and statistics and analytics, yes \u2014 but more important, you must be good at recognizing and understanding the behavioral traps that lead investors to make bad decisions.\u00a0Understanding how and why clients react to adversity and euphoria, and using this insight to guide them toward the right (or rational) decisions, is paramount in helping them achieve long-term success.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is some good news. Although we cannot reprogram our brains or behavioral instincts in a single lifetime (or even, in fact, over many generations), there are some steps we can take to mitigate the instincts that tend to make us poor investors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we can understand and accept our human side and the behavioral traits that cause us to make emotional or irrational decisions. If we know we are likely to act irrationally, and if we are able to step back and see our behavior for what it is \u2014 an impulsive reaction to stress or exuberance \u2014 we are much more likely to be able to resist.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA second way to keep emotion out of the equation \u2014 and probably the most important \u2014 is to have a plan and stick with it.\u00a0This is why a written financial plan is so important and powerful.\u00a0By planning for the future, and committing to paper what we will do in any given scenario going forward, we help eliminate the dreaded \u201cF\u201d word of finance and investing.\u00a0That \u201cF\u201d word, of course, is \u201cFeel.\u201d As soon as we \u201cfeel\u201d we must do something in the face of turbulence, we know that emotion, not reason, is running the show, and that creates a climate ripe for investing missteps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs odd as it may sound, the key to solid long-term investing is never to \u201cfeel\u201d \u2014 or, more precisely, never to \u003Cem\u003Erespond\u003C/em\u003E based on what we \u201cfeel.\u201d\u00a0So much time and energy in our business is spent debating what investment strategy is best, even though there are any number of approaches that can result in positive outcomes. What\u2019s most important is that we have a strategy and we stick to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA good financial plan or investment plan should be considered and articulated in a time of calm, so that it may act as a beacon when emotions are running high.\u00a0If we can stay focused \u2014 not on the short-term noise constantly surrounding us, but on the long-term goals we have set for ourselves \u2014 we greatly increase our chances of financial success. The key for us humans (and even half-humans) is to have a plan, and stay tethered to it, particularly when our instincts are telling us to run.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr /\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EImage via iStock.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EYou might also like:\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"row\"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"col-md-6\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/roboadvisors-sink-pretenders-propel-true-financial-advisors/\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E?aaarecs\n\u0026globalrecs\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000065116269_Medium.jpg\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\" /\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E\u003Ca href=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/roboadvisors-sink-pretenders-propel-true-financial-advisors/\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E?aaarecs\n\u0026globalrecs\"\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EWill Robo-Advisors Sink Financial Advisors?\n\n\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"col-md-6\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/stop-underperforming-investments/\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E?aaarecs\n\u0026globalrecs\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000046732344_Medium.jpg\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\" /\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E\u003Ca href=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/stop-underperforming-investments/\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E?aaarecs\n\u0026globalrecs\"\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EHow to Stop Underperforming Your Investments\n\n\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"row\"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"col-md-6\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/strong-stocks-push-investors-common-mistake/\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E?aaarecs\n\u0026globalrecs\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000054255544_Medium.jpg\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\" /\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E\u003Ca href=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/strong-stocks-push-investors-common-mistake/\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E?aaarecs\n\u0026globalrecs\"\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EStocks Strong?

Most vital of all, are you still learning on the job?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStagnation is fine for some jobs\u2014when I was a dishwasher at The Earth Kitchen vegetarian restaurant, I enjoyed shutting off my brain and focusing on the rhythmic scrubbing of burnt pans, the slosh and swirl of peas and carrots in a soapy drain\u2014but professionals, particularly web professionals, are either learning and growing or, like the love between Annie Hall and Alvy Singer, becoming \u003Ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075686/quotes?item=qt0373267\"\u003Ea dead shark\u003C/a\u003E. If you\u2019ve stopped learning on the job, it\u2019s past time to look around.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELikewise for situations where you face on-the-job discrimination. Or where you\u2019re the only one who cares about designing and building sites and applications that meet real human needs, and of which you can truly be proud. Or where, after three years of taking on senior-level tasks, and making mature decisions that helped the company, you\u2019re still seen as entry-level because you came in as an intern\u2014and first impressions are forever. Or where you will never be promoted, because the person above you is young, healthy, adored by the owner, or has burrowed in like a tick. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome companies are smart enough to promote from within. These are the companies that tend to give you an annual professional development budget to attend conferences, buy books, or take classes; that encourage you to blog and attend meet-ups. Companies that ignore or actively discourage your professional growth are not places where you will succeed. (And in most cases, they won\u2019t do that well themselves\u2014although some bad places do attain a kind of financial success by taking on the same kinds of boring jobs over and over again, and hiring employees they can treat as chattel. But that ain\u2019t you, babe.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u2019s important, when answering these questions about your organization and your place within it, to be ruthlessly honest with yourself. If you work alongside a friend whose judgement you trust, ask her what she thinks. It is all too easy, as fallible human beings, to believe that we should be promoted before we may actually be ready; to think that people are treating us unfairly when they may actually be supporting and mentoring us; to ignore valuable knowledge we pick up on the job because we think we should be learning something different. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf there\u2019s no one at your workplace you can trust with these questions, talk to a solid friend, sibling, or love partner\u2014one who is brave enough to tell you what you need to hear. Or check in with a professional\u2014be they a recruiter, job counselor, yoga instructor, barista, or therapist. But be careful not to confide in someone who may have a vested interest in betraying your confidence. (For example, a recruiter who earns $100,000 per year in commissions from your company may not be the best person to talk to about your sense that said company grossly undervalues you.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you have legitimate reasons to move on, it\u2019s time to consider those other factors: namely, have you identified the right place to move on \u003Cem\u003Eto\u003C/em\u003E? And have you protected yourself and your family by setting aside a small financial cushion (at least three months\u2019 rent in the bank) and lining up a freelance gig? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u2019t just make a move to make a move\u2014that\u2019s how careers die. Identify the characteristics of the kind of place you want to work for. What kind of work do they do? If they are agencies, what do their former customers say about them? If friends work for them, what do they say about the place? What\u2019s their company culture like? Do they boast a diverse workforce\u2014diverse psychologically, creatively, and politically as well as physically? Is there a sameness to the kind of person they hire, and if so, will you fit in or be uncomfortable? If you\u2019d be comfortable, might you be too comfortable (i.e. not learning anything new)? Human factors are every bit as important as the work, and, career-wise, more important than the money.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf five of your friends work for your current employer\u2019s biggest competitor, don\u2019t assume you can walk across the street and interview with that competitor. The competitor may feel honor-bound to tell your boss how unhappy you are\u2014and that won\u2019t do you any good. Your boss might also feel personally betrayed if you take a job with her biggest competitor, and that might be burning a bridge. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u2019t burn any bridges you don\u2019t have to. After all, you never know who you might work for\u2014or who you might want to hire\u2014five years from now. Leaving on good terms is as important as securing the right next job. Word of mouth is everything in this business, and one powerful enemy can really hurt your career. More importantly, regardless of what they can do for or against your career, it\u2019s always best to avoid hurting others when possible. After all, everyone you meet is fighting their own hard battle, so why add to their burdens?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u2019t to say you don\u2019t have the right to work for anyone you choose who chooses you back. You absolutely have the right. Just be smart and empathetic about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn some places, with some bosses, you can honestly say you\u2019re looking for a new job, and the boss will not only understand, she\u2019ll actually recommend you for a good job elsewhere. But that saintly a boss is rare\u2014and if you work for one, are you sure you want to quit? Most bosses, however professional they may be, take it personally when you leave. So be discreet while job hunting. Once you decide to take a new job, let your boss know well ahead of time, and be honest but helpful if they ask why you\u2019re leaving\u2014share reasons that are true and actionable and that, if listened to, could improve the company you\u2019re leaving. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, before job hunting, line up those three months\u2019 rent and that freelance gig. This protects you and your family if you work for a vindictive boss who fires employees he finds out are seeking outside jobs. Besides, having cash in the bank and a freelance creative challenge will boost your confidence and self-esteem, helping you do better in interviews.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA good job is like a good friend. But people grow and change, and sometimes even the best of friends must part. Knowing when to make your move will keep you ahead of the curve\u2014and the axe.

This week the Pabst Project brought me to the Star Theater to see \u003Cem\u003EThe\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cem\u003ESonics\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003EThe Pierced Arrows\u003C/em\u003E and eyebrow raising locals \u003Cem\u003EFireballs of Freedom\u003C/em\u003E. The ticket was a steal at ten dollars, following a trend of low-cost ticket prices at this venue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe atmosphere at the Star Theater is quite aesthetically pleasing, apart from the unnecessarily flashy stage lighting. The staff is exceedingly friendly and helpful with knowledge of the surrounding neighborhood. The drink service was fast even at capacity; you can purchase a 16-ounce PBR or Tecate for only three dollars, so a decent buzz is easily attained on a moderate budget. There is also a wide variety of well-mixed drinks and craft brews if you have recently cashed a paycheck and are feeling fancy. When all that cheap beer catches up with you there is Mediterranean street food available out on the patio, which looks and smells delicious but there were not many veg options, so I did not partake.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs for the show, the sound could not have been better. The Sonics were dynamic and looked comfortable performing, having only gotten back together in recent years after decades of hiatus. Judging by the crowd\u0026#8217;s reaction to the new material, I think it\u0026#8217;s safe to say they made it all that time, with their great music sensibility still intact. The Star Theater offers many great vantage points including balcony access at no extra cost if your days of rubbing shoulders with sweaty shirtless men up front are behind you. Taking this all into account I look forward to taking in some more shows at the Star Theater, with comfort in knowing my wallet will make it out guts intact.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can check out the \u003Cem\u003EFireballs of Freedom \u003C/em\u003Esupporting a stellar Australian garage rock act \u003Cem\u003ERoyal Headache \u003C/em\u003Eat Mississippi Studios on August 11\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor information on upcoming events at the Star Theater, \u003Ca href=\"http://Startheaterportland.com\"\u003Evisit their website\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information on the bands, visit:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://TheSonicsBoom.com\"\u003ETheSonicsBoom.com\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://PiercedArrows.com\"\u003EPiercedArrows.com\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://FireballsofFreedom.bandcamp.com\"\u003EFireballsofFreedom.bandcamp.com\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ESupport Local Music!\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E-Carsten\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv data-canvas-width=\"109.33869636929408\"\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe post \u003Ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://frugalportland.com/sonics-star-theater-frugal-fun-night/\"\u003EThe Sonics at the Star Theater: Frugal and Fun Night Out\u003C/a\u003E appeared first on \u003Ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://frugalportland.com\"\u003EFrugal Portland\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E","title":"The Sonics at the Star Theater: Frugal and Fun Night Out"},{"feed_item_id":1529212706,"published_at":1438254054,"created_at":1438258650,"version_key":1438258650,"updated_at":1438258650,"starred":false,"read":false,"read_later":false,"author":"Linda Vergon","feed_id":24617,"feed_name":"Get Rich Slowly - Personal Finance That Makes Sense.","url":"http://getrichslowly.org.feedsportal.com/c/34612/f/633263/s/4890b282/sc/28/l/0L0Sgetrichslowly0Borg0Cblog0C20A150C0A70C30A0Cact0Efast0Efor0Edouble0Ecash0Eback0Erewards0Efrom0Ediscover0C/story01.htm","body":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis article is by Curtis Arnold, CardRatings.com editor-in-chief.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E \u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s not often that a credit card company offers to double its usual rewards on a range of its plastic for an entire year \u0026#8212; but that\u0026#8217;s precisely what Discover is doing for new customers with its current limited-time offer.\u003C/p\u003E \u003Ch2\u003EHow the offer works\u003C/h2\u003E \u003Cp\u003EDiscover\u2019s eye-catching offer applies to cash-back cards including:\u003C/p\u003E \u003Cul\u003E \u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/go/discover-it-card-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EDiscover it card\u00ae-Double Cash Back your first year\u003C/a\u003E,\u003C/li\u003E \u003Cli\u003EDiscover it\u00ae-Double Cash Back your first year,\u003C/li\u003E \u003Cli\u003EDiscover it\u00ae chrome-Double Cash Back your first year,\u003C/li\u003E \u003Cli\u003EDiscover it\u00ae for Students-Double Cash Back your first year,\u003C/li\u003E \u003Cli\u003EDiscover it\u00ae chrome for Students-Double Cash Back your first year,\u003C/li\u003E \u003Cli\u003Eand even the new NHL\u00ae Discover it\u00ae Card.\u003C/li\u003E \u003C/ul\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere\u2019s how it works:\u003C/strong\u003E After the first 12 consecutive billing periods that your new account is open, Discover will double all the cash back rewards you\u0026#8217;ve earned and apply them to your account in the next billing cycle.

You might not recognize that fact, because the firms that oversee these plans make it all appear seamless. But if you read one of those \u201cfee disclosure\u201d statements that show up about once a year, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/2013/hidden-401k-fees-plan-retirement-account-study/\"\u003Eyou may be surprised\u003C/a\u003E to see how many people and firms are involved.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but it\u2019s something that someone should be managing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EReading through your \u201cParticipant Fee Disclosure,\u201d you\u2019ll see a host of services listed, including recordkeeping, custodial, broker or advisor, tax, and audit. Each one costs you something in the form of fees charged against accounts in the plan.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAgain, this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Many services are necessary and even required by law. However, some fees might be there for no good reason, and it\u2019s entirely possible that the fees could be lowered. Left unchallenged, excessive or unnecessary fees can directly affect when you can retire and the lifestyle you can afford in retirement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EThe importance of reasonable fees\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u2019s a trade-off when it comes to fee negotiations. Your employer wants (or, if it\u2019s paying attention, \u003Cem\u003Eshould \u003C/em\u003Ewant) the highest possible level of service for the lowest possible price. Every once in a while, it should be addressing each provider of services to your plan to re-evaluate the services and the fees. Why? Because most providers are paid based on the size of the plan. This means that as the total value of the plan grows, they make more money. If this fact is ignored for long, they end up making significantly more money for doing the same work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout getting into the details of how fee negotiations take place, let\u2019s talk about their impact on your retirement readiness.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENo one will argue that lower fees have anything other than a positive benefit to you and others \u003Ca href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/retirement-calculator/\"\u003Esaving for retirement\u003C/a\u003E in the plan. All other things being equal, lowering plan-servicing fees can reduce the time you\u2019ll need to work (and save) to retire successfully. This doesn\u2019t mean everything should be as cheap as possible; it simply means that whatever fees you pay should be reasonably in line with the services the plan receives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, what if your employer doesn\u2019t care enough to gauge the plan\u2019s fees, or doesn\u2019t have the knowledge needed to affect the plan in a good way? This happens sometimes. A prime example: retirement plans that are \u201csold direct.\u201d This means that a big company, usually a mutual fund or insurance company, offers to run all components of the plan. The provider bundles all of the services together, reduces its own costs wherever possible and charges as much as it can get away with. It\u2019s unlikely someone arm-wrestles them over the fees they charge. This often results in years\u2019 worth of extra charges on employees\u2019 accounts might have been waived had there been an effective negotiation. Providers also often load plans with their in-house proprietary products and services, which make them even more money.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EBad bundles are no bargain\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo the untrained eye, these \u201cbundled\u201d providers might seem like a bargain\u2014 until you discover that they often charge a fee to manage their own investment products, which have fees themselves, and then sell other things to employees and tack on various additional charges.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe came across a very good example of this recently when we helped a plan that was being charged a fee on all assets (which the provider dropped when pressed). Most of the investments in the plan were the provider\u2019s own offerings; plus, the provider was defaulting employees into its proprietary \u003Ca href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/finance/financial-advisors/questions?search=target+date+fund\"\u003Etarget date funds\u003C/a\u003E and charging anyone who wanted extra help an additional 1% fee. There were other layers of fees as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBundled plans are not all bad, but it\u2019s always good to question how objective and fair they\u2019re being with you. Find out whether the fees you\u2019re paying are reasonable, and fight for the best possible suite of services you can get.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso look closely at your plan\u2019s advisor. Running workplace retirement plans is tricky business, and a very specialized financial discipline. If the company owner\u2019s personal stockbroker is also your plan advisor, someone at your company should question this relationship. If an insurance agent or someone at your company\u2019s bank is also your plan advisor, the chances are good that you do not have an objective advocate in your corner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOverwhelmingly, employers take their duty seriously, focusing entirely on putting together the best plan they can. More and more companies are even discovering that this approach helps them in a number of long-term ways as well. For example, a company\u2019s \u003Ca href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/finance/financial-advisors/questions/healthcare\"\u003Ehealth care costs\u003C/a\u003E can be lowered when its employees can retire at a normal age, rather than working years longer to make up for the savings drained away by excessive fees.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome employers don\u2019t care as much. They might simply allow the plan to be parked somewhere convenient and not pay attention to the fees.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you go your entire career without a solid advocate in your corner, you should expect to have to work extra years to make up for the difference. Unfortunately, where your 401(k) plan is concerned, there\u2019s no do-over. You\u2019ll be exactly as successful as that combination of all those years of saving provide for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr /\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EImage via iStock.\u00a0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EYou might also like:\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"row\"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"col-md-6\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/retirement-plans-rife-conflicts-interest/\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E?aaarecs\n\u0026globalrecs\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000064916337_Medium.jpg\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\" /\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E\u003Ca href=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/retirement-plans-rife-conflicts-interest/\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E?aaarecs\n\u0026globalrecs\"\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003ERetirement Plan Industry Ripe for Revolution?\n\n\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"col-md-6\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/new-college-grads-starting-retirement-savings-top-priority/\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E?aaarecs\n\u0026globalrecs\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000025291326_Medium.jpg\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\" /\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E\u003Ca href=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/new-college-grads-starting-retirement-savings-top-priority/\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E?aaarecs\n\u0026globalrecs\"\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003ERecent Grads are Failing on Retirement Savings\n\n\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"row\"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"col-md-6\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/key-successful-retirement-planning-save-save-save/\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E?aaarecs\n\u0026globalrecs\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000065661167_Medium.jpg\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\" /\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E\u003Ca href=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/key-successful-retirement-planning-save-save-save/\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E?aaarecs\n\u0026globalrecs\"\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EThe One Key to Successful Retirement Planning\n\n\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"col-md-6\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/curtain-target-date-funds/\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E?aaarecs\n\u0026globalrecs\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000058199886_Medium.jpg\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\" /\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E\u003Ca href=\"\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003Ehttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/curtain-target-date-funds/\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E?aaarecs\n\u0026globalrecs\"\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EBehind the Curtain of Target Date Funds\n\n\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","title":"High-Fee 401(k) Convenient for Employer, Costly for You"},{"feed_item_id":1527615659,"published_at":1438181773,"created_at":1438183212,"version_key":1438206143,"updated_at":1438206143,"starred":false,"read":true,"read_later":false,"author":"Gabe","feed_id":4926,"feed_name":"Macdrifter","url":"http://www.macdrifter.com/2015/07/the-backblaze-2015-hard-drive-failure-results-link.html","body":"\u003Cp\u003EBasically, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-reliability-stats-for-q2-2015/\"\u003EWestern Digital is still way better than Seagate\u003C/a\u003E even with a smaller sample size for WD.

I don\u2019t like riding while listening to my iPhone. Even back when I had a nice armband for it, I felt uncomfortable using it. Part of it was how the iPhone would shift around during my ride, part of it was the impossibility of controlling playback through a touchscreen while on the move, part of it was the annoyance of moving the phone into and out of its pouch, and part of it was my fear of damaging the phone during even the lightest and spottiest rain. After my wife borrowed the armband on a permanent basis, I rode with the phone in a pocket of my bike shorts, and that was even worse. The earbud cords would occasionally catch on flap of material as I was riding and pull the buds out of my ears.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I decided to return to using my old 5th generation iPod nano. That meant resubscribing to podcasts in iTunes and syncing the iPod via cable, Not a big deal, but because I still intend to listen through the iPhone, I thought it would be better to switch away from \u003Ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?mt=8\u0026amp;uo=4\u0026amp;at=10l4Fv\"\u003EOvercast\u003C/a\u003E and use the Apple\u2019s Podcasts app to take advantage of its integration with iTunes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis shows how out of touch I am with the current state of the software I have hidden away in the \u201cApple Junk\u201d folder on my last home page.

Oh sure, when you plug your iPhone into your Mac, you can sync the podcasts in iTunes with those in Podcasts, but they don\u2019t stay in sync over the air the way Contacts and Calendars do. At first I thought there was some iCloud setting that I\u2019d forgotten to turn on, but no. Both Podcasts and iTunes will use their internet connections to download episodes but there\u2019s no coordination between the two.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the one feature that Podcasts could have that would set it apart from third-party podcatchers, the integration of devices and services that Apple touts as its great differentiator, isn\u2019t present. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s poorly implemented, like some other Apple audio service I could mention, it\u2019s not implemented at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich is kind of a relief, because after listening to one and a half podcasts through the Podcasts app, I knew it\u2019d drive me crazy. The overall interface is fine, and the sleep timer is actually quite well done compared to other podcast apps. But it\u2019s missing one feature I find essential when I\u2019m listening in my car: the ability to skip forward and backward within a podcast by turning the Tune knob on the dashboard. This knob works like double- or triple-clicking the center control on a set of earbuds, and most podcast apps have a setting to switch those functions from \u201cnext track\u201d and \u201cprevious track\u201d to \u201cskip forward X seconds\u201d and \u201cskip back Y seconds.\u201d This is essential when you need to repeat that jumble of noise when everyone was talking at once on The Incomparable. Or, more commonly, when you\u2019re not in the mood to hear again the story of how the guys from Harry\u2019s bought that razor blade factory in Germany.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I deleted everything from Podcasts and returned to Overcast. Podcasts didn\u2019t even get out of the Apple Junk folder.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut let\u2019s end on a positive note. My 5th generation nano, six years old, worked perfectly with iTunes 12 and is now set up to be my biking iPod. In fact, even my 2nd generation nano, which I grabbed by mistake and plugged into my Mac before I realized it was the wrong one, synced up fine. Its select button is kind of wonky\u2014that\u2019s partly why I got the 5th gen\u2014but otherwise it runs just fine. And it\u2019s nine years old. The only hitch in syncing them was that iTunes didn\u2019t recognize either nano immediately because their batteries were dead dead dead. Once they got a little juice in them, everything went fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the \u003Ca href=\"http://www.relay.fm/upgrade/47\"\u003Ecurrent episode of Upgrade\u003C/a\u003E, Jason Snell told how \u003Ca href=\"http://sixcolors.com/post/2015/07/revitalizing-an-old-ipod-with-owcs-iflash-adapter/\"\u003Ehe revitalized an old classic iPod\u003C/a\u003E by installing an internal SD card reader to replace the hard drive.

We recently received an alert about a new scheme to defraud advisors and their clients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe scam begins with an email to an advisor that includes a bogus invoice. The email appears to come from a client, and it includes a request to send money directly to the business listed on the invoice. The invoice might appear to be for purchases such as antiques or art, or for such things as attorney fees or legal settlements. The advisor sends the money, and the fraud is complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe payee is often in a foreign country or at an overseas bank. This makes it nearly impossible to catch the thieves or reclaim the money.

You can, in theory, do the same thing by writing a little skeleton program that tests your regex, but if you\u2019re anything like me, you don\u2019t have the patience for that. Three bucks is a small price to pay for prebuilt testing environment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing you should know before using Patterns: No matter which language is chosen in the dropdown menu up near the top right corner, Patterns always uses Perl-style references for captured groups in the replacement section, e.g., \u003Ccode\u003E$1\u003C/code\u003E for the first parenthesized group, \u003Ccode\u003E$2\u003C/code\u003E for the second, etc. So even if you\u2019re writing in Python, as I usually am, you can\u2019t use Python\u2019s syntax, which uses backslashes instead dollar signs. This is less annoying than you might think\u2014so many languages and utilities use dollar signs, I\u2019m used to switching back and forth between the two styles. For example, the regex above is from my Keyboard Maestro macro for \u003Ca href=\"http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/07/quick-image-links-with-keyboard-maestro/\"\u003Equick image links\u003C/a\u003E; Keyboard Maestro uses Perl-style group references.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u2019re not familiar with regular expressions, you should be, especially if you\u2019re interested in automating your work with a computer. They are a sort of mini-language for describing patterns of text, and knowing them will greatly expand your ability to search and replace. I first learned regex syntax back in the mid-90s from the \u201cSearching with Grep\u201d chapter in the \u003Ca href=\"http://www.barebones.com/bbedit/\"\u003EBBEdit\u003C/a\u003E manual (a chapter written by John Gruber, if I remember correctly). If you don\u2019t own BBEdit, there are millions of regex tutorials on the web.

Attack debt\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPaying off debt to free up more cash to tuck into savings is a wonderful tactic because it\u2019s easy to see progress and ultimate success. Even when financing with very low or no interest for cars, for example, the habit of paying off quickly puts savers on track for larger savings. I like the \u201csnowball\u201d method of debt elimination \u2014 ordering your debts from smallest to largest (or from highest interest rate to lowest), and then knocking them out one by one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Draw up a financial plan\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, this may sound a little self-serving, as I\u2019m a financial planner. But successful savers usually have a \u003Ca href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/finance/financial-advisors/questions?search=budgeting\"\u003Eroad map\u003C/a\u003E so they can follow their progress. By putting saving goals in writing and knowing where they are in relation to those goals, savers can recognize when changes are necessary \u2014 or can celebrate being ahead of schedule.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Read personal finance media\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most successful savers are always looking for new ideas and new ways to reach their goals sooner and with more assurance. One of the reasons we give our clients subscriptions to magazines such as Money or Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance is to \u003Ca href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/tips/extra-ways-pay-credit-card-debt/\"\u003Eexpose them to ideas\u003C/a\u003E \u2014 show them what they should (and shouldn\u2019t) be doing. We also tweet articles that can help them meet their financial goals, including saving.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr /\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EImage via iStock.\u00a0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","title":"6 Habits of Highly Successful Savers"},{"feed_item_id":1525594548,"published_at":1438095877,"created_at":1438096212,"version_key":1438102689,"updated_at":1438102689,"starred":false,"read":true,"read_later":false,"author":null,"feed_id":2463,"feed_name":"kung fu grippe","url":"http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/125261256624","body":"\u201cRoderick on the Line - John Roderick of the Long Winters and Merlin Mann of the Internet talk about what\u2019s wrong with the world and how John could fix it all, if all those idiots would just get out of his way.\u201d\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E - \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://jimmymarks.github.io/podcastjustice/##Roderick+on+the+Line+%C2%A7+-+John+Roderick+of+the+Long+Winters+and+Merlin+Mann+of+the+Internet+talk+about+what%E2%80%99s+wrong+with+the+world+and+how+John+could+fix+it+all%2C+if+all+those+idiots+would+just+get+out+of+his+way.\"\u003EHow to Listen to Podcasts\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI have nothing to add here.

Rather than sitting on it all, I figured I\u2019d write a series of posts sharing what I learned in case it\u2019s helpful to anyone else. This first post looks at the general architecture of proxy browsers.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the original story of the Wizard of Oz, the Emerald City isn\u0026rsquo;t actually green nor made entirely of emeralds. All of that came later. In the original story, before entering the city each person had to put on a pair of glasses. These glasses, they were told, would protect them from the bright glow of all the emeralds that would surely damage their sight. These glasses were attached and never removed. You wore them while eating, while going to the bathroom, while walking outside\u2014you wore them everywhere and all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was all a ruse. The glow of the city wouldn\u0026rsquo;t damage anybody\u0026rsquo;s sight because there was no glow. That all came from the glasses which just happened to be tinted green. Through the lens of those glasses, \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E glowed. The lens through which those people viewed their world shaped their perception of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u2019d venture to say that most developers and designers are not big fans of proxy browsers\u2014assuming they pay attention to them at all. They don\u2019t behave in ways a typical browser does, which leads to frustration as we see our carefully created sites fall apart for seemingly no reason at all. And frankly, most of us don\u2019t really need to use them on a day-to-day basis. Through the lens we view the web, proxy browsers are merely troublesome relics of a time before the idea of a \u0026ldquo;smartphone\u0026rdquo; was anything other than a pipedream.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut our view of the web is not the only view of the web. People all over the world face challenges getting online\u2014everything from the cost of data and poor connectivity to religious and political obstacles. In these environments proxy browsers are far from troublesome; they are essential.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo while most of us building for the web have never used a proxy browser (outside of the quick spot check in Opera Mini, perhaps), they remain incredibly popular globally. Opera Mini, the most popular of all proxy browsers, boasts about \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHO70H9tvqo\"\u003E350 million users\u003C/a\u003E. UC, another popular proxy browser, boasts 100 million daily active users and is the most popular mobile browser in India, China and Indonesia.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese browsers perform optimizations and transcoding that can provide significant improvements. Several proxy browsers claim up to 90% data savings when compared to a typical browser. That\u2019s the difference between a 2MB site and a 200kb site\u2014nothing to sneeze at.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo understand how they accomplish this\u2014and why they behave the way they do\u2014we first need to revisit what we know about how browsers work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003ETypical Browser Architecture\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csvg class=\"diagram\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"440.3\" height=\"144.2\" viewBox=\"0 0 440.3 144.2\"\u003E\u003Cpath fill=\"#010101\" d=\"M64.8 0H13.5C6.1 0 0 6.1 0 13.5v105.3c0 7.4 6.1 13.5 13.5 13.5h51.3c7.4 0 13.5-6.1 13.5-13.5V13.5C78.3 6.1 72.2 0 64.8 0zM38.7 125.1c-3.6 0-6.7-3-6.7-6.7 0-3.6 3-6.7 6.7-6.7 3.8 0 6.7 3 6.7 6.7s-3 6.7-6.7 6.7zm28.8-18.5H10.8V17.5h56.7v89.1zM434.1 47H311.4c-3.4 0-6.2 2.8-6.2 6.2v26.9c0 3.4 2.8 6.2 6.2 6.2h122.8c3.4 0 6.2-2.8 6.2-6.2V53.2c-.1-3.4-2.8-6.2-6.3-6.2zm-37.8 25.6H319v-12h77.3v12zm27.8-.4c-3.1 0-5.6-2.5-5.6-5.6s2.5-5.6 5.6-5.6c3.1 0 5.6 2.5 5.6 5.6s-2.5 5.6-5.6 5.6zm10 19.8H311.4c-3.4 0-6.2 2.8-6.2 6.2v26.9c0 3.4 2.8 6.2 6.2 6.2h122.8c3.4 0 6.2-2.8 6.2-6.2V98.2c-.1-3.4-2.8-6.2-6.3-6.2zm-37.8 25.6H319v-12h77.3v12zm27.8-.4c-3.1 0-5.6-2.5-5.6-5.6 0-3.1 2.5-5.6 5.6-5.6 3.1 0 5.6 2.5 5.6 5.6 0 3.1-2.5 5.6-5.6 5.6zM434.1 1H311.4c-3.4 0-6.2 2.8-6.2 6.2v26.9c0 3.4 2.8 6.2 6.2 6.2h122.8c3.4 0 6.2-2.8 6.2-6.2V7.2c-.1-3.4-2.8-6.2-6.3-6.2zm-37.8 25.6H319v-12h77.3v12zm27.8-.4c-3.1 0-5.6-2.5-5.6-5.6s2.5-5.6 5.6-5.6c3.1 0 5.6 2.5 5.6 5.6s-2.5 5.6-5.6 5.6z\"/\u003E\u003Cpath fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#CE561E\" stroke-width=\"4\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" d=\"M102.3 84.8h175.6\"/\u003E\u003Cpath fill=\"#CE561E\" d=\"M261.2 96.6c-.4-.6-.2-1.3.4-1.7l15.7-10-15.7-10c-.6-.4-.7-1.1-.4-1.7.4-.6 1.1-.7 1.7-.4l17.4 11.1c.4.2.6.6.6 1s-.2.8-.6 1L262.9 97c-.2.1-.4.2-.7.2-.4-.1-.8-.3-1-.6z\"/\u003E\u003Cpath fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#CE561E\" stroke-width=\"4\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" d=\"M280.8 46.6H105.2\"/\u003E\u003Cpath fill=\"#CE561E\" d=\"M121.9 34.8c.4.6.2 1.3-.4 1.7l-15.7 10 15.7 10c.6.4.7 1.1.4 1.7-.4.6-1.1.7-1.7.4l-17.4-11.1c-.4-.2-.6-.6-.6-1s.2-.8.6-1l17.4-11.1c.2-.1.4-.2.7-.2.4.1.8.3 1 .6z\"/\u003E\u003Cpath fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#CE561E\" stroke-width=\"4\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" d=\"M102.3 13.6h175.6\"/\u003E\u003Cpath fill=\"#CE561E\" d=\"M261.2 25.3c-.4-.6-.2-1.3.4-1.7l15.7-10-15.7-10c-.6-.4-.7-1.1-.4-1.7.4-.6 1.1-.7 1.7-.4l17.4 11.1c.4.2.6.6.6 1s-.2.8-.6 1l-17.4 11.1c-.2.1-.4.2-.7.2-.4 0-.8-.2-1-.6z\"/\u003E\u003Cg\u003E\u003Cpath fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#CE561E\" stroke-width=\"4\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" d=\"M280.8 119.3H105.2\"/\u003E\u003Cpath fill=\"#CE561E\" d=\"M121.9 107.6c.4.6.2 1.3-.4 1.7l-15.7 10 15.7 10c.6.4.7 1.1.4 1.7-.4.6-1.1.7-1.7.4l-17.4-11.1c-.4-.2-.6-.6-.6-1s.2-.8.6-1l17.4-11.1c.2-.1.4-.2.7-.2.4.1.8.3 1 .6z\"/\u003E\u003C/g\u003E\u003Ccircle fill=\"#010101\" stroke=\"#FFF\" stroke-width=\"4\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" cx=\"59.9\" cy=\"106.2\" r=\"35.9\"/\u003E\u003Cg fill=\"#FFF\" stroke=\"#010101\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\"\u003E\u003Cpath d=\"M47.2 97.3l-9.6 9.7 9.6 9.7c.9.9 2.3.9 3.2 0 .9-.9.9-2.3 0-3.2l-6.1-6.2-1.8 1.2 7.9-8c.4-.4.7-1 .7-1.6 0-.6-.2-1.2-.7-1.6-.9-.9-2.4-.9-3.2 0zM73.5 97.3l9.6 9.7-9.6 9.7c-.9.9-2.3.9-3.2 0-.9-.9-.9-2.3 0-3.2l6.1-6.2 1.8 1.2-7.9-8c-.4-.4-.7-1-.7-1.6s.2-1.2.7-1.6c.9-.9 2.4-.9 3.2 0zM65.9 98.1c-.2-.5-.6-1-1.2-1.3-1.1-.5-2.5 0-2.9 1.2l-7 16.2c-.2.6-.2 1.2 0 1.7s.6 1 1.2 1.3c1.1.5 2.5 0 2.9-1.2l7-16.2c.2-.6.2-1.2 0-1.7z\"/\u003E\u003C/g\u003E\u003C/svg\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA typical modern browser goes through a series of steps to go from the URL you enter in your address bar to the page you ultimately see on your screen.

These browsers alter the typical browser behavior only slightly, and as a result they provide the least benefit for end users as well as\u2014usually\u2014the least noticeable impact on the display and behavior of a web site. (While not really tied to a browser, look at \u003Ca href=\"http://googleweblight.com/\"\u003EGoogle\u0026rsquo;s search transcoding service\u003C/a\u003E for an example of how substantially a proxy service \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E alter the display of a page.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of requests being routed directly from the client to the web server, they are first routed through some intermediary layer of servers (Google\u2019s servers, UC\u2019s servers, Opera\u2019s servers, etc). This intermediary layer provides the proxy service. It routes the request to the web server on behalf of the client. Upon receipt of the request, it sees if there are any optimizations it can provide (such as minification, image compression, etc) before passing back the potentially altered response to the client.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe browser-specific behavior (steps 4-8) remains the same as the typical browsers you\u0026rsquo;re used to testing on. All of the optimizations that take place focus primarily on the reducing the impact on the network (1-3).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are many examples but at the moment of writing some of the more popular options in this category are Google\u2019s Data Compression tool (Flywheel), UC Web\u2019s Cloud Boost, and Opera Turbo.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003ERemote

They aggressively optimize as much as possible providing a much larger benefit for the end user, but also a lot more trouble for developers. (If that bothers you try to remember that the proxy browsers exist because users need them, not because developers do.) These are the browsers you more typically think of when hearing the term \u0026ldquo;proxy browser\u0026rdquo;. With the increase in browsers offering proxy services, I think referring to these as remote browsers can be a helpful way of distinguishing them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike their more conservative brethren, remote browsers are not content to merely make a few optimizations on the network side of things. They\u2019ve got more ambitious goals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a website is requested through a remote browser, the request is routed through an intermediary server first before being forwarded on to the web server. Sounds familiar right? But here\u2019s where remote browsers start to break away from the traditional browser model.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs that request returns to the server, instead of the intermediary server routing it back to the client, it proceeds to request all the subsequent resources needed to display the page as well. It then performs all parsing, rendering, layout and paint on the intermediary server. Finally, when all of that is taken care of, it sends back some sort of snapshot of that page to the client. This snapshot does not consist of HTML, CSS and JavaScript\u2014it\u2019s a proprietary format determined by whatever the browser happens to be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u2019s why calling them \u201cremote browsers\u201d makes so much sense. The browser as we know it is really contained on the server. The application on the phone or tablet is nothing more than a thin-client that is capable of serving up some proprietary format. It just so happens that when it serves that format up, it looks like a web page.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most important thing to remember for remote browsers is that because all they are doing is displaying a snapshot of a page, \u003Cem\u003Eanything that might change the display of that page requires a trip back to the server so an updated snapshot can be generated\u003C/em\u003E. We\u0026rsquo;ll discuss that in more detail in a later post as the implications are huge and the source of most proxy browser induced headaches.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are many options, but Opera Mini, UC Mini and Puffin are some of the more popular.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhat\u2019s up next?\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding the basic architecture of proxy browsers makes testing on them so much easier and far more predictable. It\u0026rsquo;s the key to understanding all of the atypical behavior that causes so many developers to cringe whenever they have to fire up a proxy browser for testing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the foundation laid, we can spend the next several posts digging deeper into the specific optimizations the two categories of proxy browsers make as well as consider the implications for developers.\u003C/p\u003E","title":"Understanding Proxy Browsers: Architecture"}]}
